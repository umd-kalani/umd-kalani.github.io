        <h2>Birth</h2>
        <p>Bei Bei was born on August 22, 2015 at 10:07 PM, together with a twin who was born at 5:35 PM that died
            from
            pneumonia 4 days after their birth. His mother is Mei Xiang.[2][3][4] His father, via artificial
            insemination, is National Zoo panda Tian Tian.[5] As of October 7, 2015 he weighed 5 lbs (1.8 kg).[6] As
            of
            November 21, 2019, he weighed 240 pounds (108 kg).[1]</p>

        <h2>Naming</h2>
        <p>On September 25, 2015, five weeks after the birth of the baby panda, he was named "Bei Bei" by Michelle
            Obama
            and Peng Liyuan, the first ladies of the United States and the People's Republic of China, respectively.
            The
            name was selected from a list of suggestions by officials from the National Zoo and the Wolong National
            Nature Reserve in China's Sichuan Province. The National Zoo preferred the name Ping Ping (平平, "peace"),
            while "Bei Bei" was the staff choice at Wolong;[3][7] doubled names are usually chosen because they are
            diminutive in Chinese. The first ladies revealed the name in both English and Mandarin, assisted by
            third-grade students from a Chinese-immersion elementary school in Washington, D.C. The name means
            "precious" or "treasure", the same as his 2-year-old sister Bao Bao.[2] Zoo director Dennis Kelly
            admitted
            that the name is likely to give rise to jokes and wordplay linking the name to "baby".[4]</p>

        <p>Before the naming ceremony, Kelly said, "It's a very exciting day because it celebrates more than four
            decades of research and success on the giant panda, and to have it recognized by the two first ladies is
            an
            honor."[7]</p>

        <h2>Viewing</h2>
        <p>Bei Bei made his first public viewing on January 16, 2016.[8] After 3 and a half years viewed at the zoo,
            the
            panda was sent to China to participate in a breeding program.[9] On Tuesday, November 19, 2019, Bei Bei
            departed the National Zoo with veterinarian, Dr. Donald Neiffer, and his life-long keeper Laurie
            Thompson on
            the FedEx Panda Express to China. He landed in Chengdu, China on Wednesday, November 20, 2019, and spent
            30
            days in quarantine before moving to the Chengdu Panda bases.</p>
