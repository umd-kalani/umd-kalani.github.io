    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This recipe is courtesy of Pioneer Square D&E, a neighborhood bistro offering creative yet comforting, from
        scratch fare. Founded by Seattle hospitality industry experts, husband and wife Jonathan Fleming and Libby
        Aker, D&E opened Fall 2018 and quickly became a popular neighborhood staple. With previously scaled down its
        offerings due to COVID restrictions, the restaurant is now fully re-open for dine-in, patio seating as well
        as takeout. The recent addition of Anthony Tran as Head Chef, paves the way for a new menu featuring the
        classic fried chicken selections known and loved by the regulars, as well as new seasonal items. The
        restaurant is located at 314 2nd Avenue South in Seattle. Find menus, directions, hours and more at
